EVTNAME90823210;The $CAPITAL$ Gospel Riots;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90823210;Since before the independence of any Greek state, a debate was raging within the Greek intelligentsia concerning the 'correct' form of the Greek language that should be used. Adamantios Korais created Katharevousa, or 'purific', in the early 1800s. Essentially a constructed language, it sought to remove all traces of Byzantine and early modern influences on Greek, reverting to a language more akin to ancient Greek. This 'purific' language became the language of the state, but the people spoke Demotic, a language which evolved naturally from Medieval Greek. The debate took an ugly turn in $CAPITAL$ today, when the translation of a part of the Gospel into Demotic in a local newspaper caused a riot and the death of eight people. The Greek Orthodox Church has forbidden the teaching of Demotic, but there is a growing movement advocating for the abandonment of the made-up language that is Katharevousa in favour of the organic Demotic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

arcadia_coal_rush_desc;Arcadia, though portrayed as a pastoral utopia in European art and literature, is actually home to a rather large deposit of coal. Tapping into that deposit would greatly help $COUNTRY$ in its effort to industrialise, though unfortunately it is coal of a rather poor grade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

adopt_standard_modern_greek_desc;The Greek Language Question needs to be settled. The constructed language that is Katharevousa is a hinderance to the general population, which finds it utterly useless in everyday life. Adopting Standard Modern Greek, a mix of Demotic with some Katharevousa influences, will boost the nation's literacy efforts and provide the masses with the instruction they need to succeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

revert_to_katharevousa_desc;The adoption of Standard Modern Greek is an affront to the moral order of the nation and a vile attack on Greek civilisation. The Demotic idiom is not only corrupting the Greek language, but also the minds of the nation's youth. We must instill a deep sense of direct lineage between our nation and the ancient Greeks, and that includes the re-adoption of Katharevousa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
