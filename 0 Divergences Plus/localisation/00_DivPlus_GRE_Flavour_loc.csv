EVTNAME90823200;Restoring the Acropolis of Athens;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90823200;In the centuries since the fall of Athens, the most pre-eminent ancient Greek city of the Greek mainland, its famed Acropolis has slowly but steadily declined. The jewel of the complex, the Temple to Athena Parthenos, or Athena the Virgin, was first converted into a Christian temple in the Byzantine years and dedicated to the Virgin Mary. During the Ottoman occupation, the church was converted to a mosque. At the same time, the Acropolis itself became a fortified village, with houses occupying every inch of the Sacred Rock. The Franks built extensive fortifications, especially around the Propylaea, while the Venetians used the Parthenon as a munitions storage facility, causing the building to blow up in 1687 and damaging it severely. Now that $COUNTRY$ is in control of Athens, we should think about clearing the Sacred Rock and restoring the Parthenon and the other monuments scattered on the hill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC90823201;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has made a concerted national effort over the last couple of years in its efforst to de-Ottomanise and de-Byzantinise the Acropolis of Athens, the famous symbol of ancient Greek civilisation. The works included removing all traces of the Ottoman village that was built on top of the Sacred Rock, as well as restoring the Parthenon, which was severely damaged by a Venetian explosion in 1687. The restorers introduced modern technology such as steel beams to the building, helping it stabilise. They assured the international community that the steel would definitely not corrode and damage the monument, needing a another huge restoration project 100 years down the line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC90823204;The glorious history of ancient Greece is a constant inspiration for Greeks all over the world, and no nomument personifies this feeling more than the Parthenon. Even when Athens was in Ottoman hands, and when Ottoman forces were using it as a fortress, Greeks felt so strongly about the monument that they offered the Ottomans ammunition rather than let them continue try to melt the lead brackets holding the marbles together to make bullets. The restoration of the Acropolis and its opening-up to visitors is a huge national consciousness boost to the Greeks of $COUNTRY$, but also the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME90823210;The $CAPITAL$ Gospel Riots;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90823210;Since before the independence of any Greek state, a debate was raging within the Greek intelligentsia concerning the 'correct' form of the Greek language that should be used. Adamantios Korais created Katharevousa, or 'purific', in the early 1800s. Essentially a constructed language, it sought to remove all traces of Byzantine and early modern influences on Greek, reverting to a language more akin to ancient Greek. This 'purific' language became the language of the state, but the people spoke Demotic, a language which evolved naturally from Medieval Greek. The debate took an ugly turn in $CAPITAL$ today, when the translation of a part of the Gospel into Demotic in a local newspaper caused a riot and the death of eight people. The Greek Orthodox Church has forbidden the teaching of Demotic, but there is a growing movement advocating for the abandonment of the made-up language that is Katharevousa in favour of the organic Demotic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Since then the volcano has continued to sporadically erupt, and in the early hours of today the ancient caldera exploded once again as crowds watched in awe from the shore and from ships docked nearby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The constructed language that is Katharevousa is a hinderance to the general population, which finds it utterly useless in everyday life.
