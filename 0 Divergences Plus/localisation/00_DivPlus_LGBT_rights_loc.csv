EVTNAME90825000;Research on the Riddle of Man-Manly Love;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90825000;In the city of Hanover, a man by the name of Karl Heinrich Ulrichs has began publishing a series of papers on homosexuality collectively entitled 'Research on the Riddle of Man-Manly Love'. Ulrichs, an unapologetically homosexual lawyer, is campaigning for the decriminalisation of what he calls 'Uranian' (from Uranus, a reference to the section of Plato's Symposium discussing love) acts between consenting adults on the grounds of homosexuality being hereditary. Though a vibrant 'Uranian' subculture has been present in the large cities of Europe since time immemorial, the rise of Christianity saw the introduction of severe penalties for same-sex acts, in some jurisdiction including the death sentence. The rise of the printing press, as well as a lesser emphasis on moralism, has allowed people like Ulrichs to become more vocal of their opposition to religious-based condemnation of homosexuality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME90825001;The Order of Chaeronea;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90825001;Ever since Roman times, London has been a centre for LGBT culture. With the rise of Christianity, homosexuality in London was condemned but, from a legal standpoint, largely ignored. In recent decades the rise in moralist thinking by the local $COUNTRY_ADJ$ administration, as well as a general anti-homosexual hysteria, has seen the introduction of numerous laws aimed at the further criminalisation of homosexual acts. This has caused the homosexual community to go further underground and develop a secret language known as Polari. To counter the rising repression, local Londoners including writer Oscar Wilde, and lead by George Cecil Ives, created a secret society known as the Order of Chaeronea - a reference to the ancient Greek Band of Thebes, composed of homosexual lovers. The stated aim of the secret Order, which quickly became international, was the cultivation of a homosexual moral, ethical, cultural and spiritual ethos, as well as the decriminalisation of homosexuality between consenting adults.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME90825002;The Gay Village;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90825002;As $COUNTRY$ steams forward on the path of progress, $CAPITAL$ has developed a reputation as a queer capital. This is particularly evident in the local 'gay village', the first of its kind, a neighbourhood home to numerous LGBT venues including so-called 'gay bars', Cabarets, cinemas, and other establishments. In contrast to other cities around the world, $CAPITAL$ is a safe haven for homosexuals and other queer people, providing a relatively safe environment in which homosexuals can live, work, and create art. Although stigma around homosexuality still exists throughout $COUNTRY$, the open display of queer identities is a sign that we are becoming progressively more accepting of individual differences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME90825003;The First Same-Sex Marriage since Roman Times;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90825003;In the town of A Coruña, in $COUNTRY$, in 1901, an event took place that, as far as we know, had not occured in Europe since the years of the Roman Empire: two people of the same sex got officially married. The two women, Marcela Gracia Ibeas and Elisa Sánchez Loriga, got married at the Church of Saint George. To do this, Elisa had to assume a male identity as 'Mario Sánchez'. Though their neighbours had previously kept quiet about the two women's relationship, upon hearing of their marriage they could no longer keep quiet. The news broke in the local newspaper, La Voz de Galicia, and quickly spread around Europe. With homosexuality now legal in $COUNTRY$, there has been increasing pressure on the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ authorities to prosecute the two women, but to no avail. Their marriage was never annulled by the church, and so they remain happily married.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC90825005;As $COUNTRY$ lurches to the right, the re-criminalisation of homosexuality has meant the end of the $CAPITAL$ Gay Village.

decriminalise_homosexuality_desc;Homosexual acts between consenting adults are illegal in $COUNTRY$, resulting in the misery of countless individuals through persecution, imprisonment, and sometimes even death - all because of their choice of partner. Such a moralist approach is an affront to civil liberties, and we must remove the state from peoples' bedrooms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

recriminalise_homosexuality_desc;$COUNTRY$ previously made the decision to decriminalise homosexual activity - this was a grave error, and we have strayed from the moral teachings of our religion and our traditions. A re-introduction of those provisions of the penal code which criminalised homosexual activity between consenting adults is in order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
