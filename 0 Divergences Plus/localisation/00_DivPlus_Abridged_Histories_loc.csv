EVTDESC90822000;Since the fall of the Byzantine Empire, the ethnically-diverse region of Macedonia had been dominated by the Ottoman Empire. While Ottoman control was at first welcomed, as it provided stability and economic prosperity to a region ravaged by centuries of war, by the 19th century the Ottoman state had began to show signs of stagnation. The economy became underdeveloped compared to the rest of Europe, and foreign powers began to interfere in Ottoman affairs. By the time the Glorious Revolution erupted in southern Greece in 1824, Macedonia too was ripe for revolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC90822001;Macedonia, unlike the south of Greece, was much less homogenous. Greeks, Bulgars, Turks, and Jews all scattered the land. The Greeks and Bulgars, though both Orthodox, loathed each other just as much, if not more, than the Turks. The Jews were indifferent to the struggle for independence, for they enjoyed the privilege of being the majority in the Macedonian capital of Thessalonica - the only city in Europe at the time to have a Jewish majority - and were largely left to their own devices by the Ottoman authorities. To organise a revolution in such circumstances would be an almost insurmountable task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC90822002;The defeat of the Greek revolutionaries at the hands of the Ottomans, the subsequent Venetian intervention, and the eventual annexation of Greece to the so-called Venetian 'Republic' was a wake-up call for the Greeks and Bulgars of Macedonia - the foreign powers were not going to be their saviours. They needed to band together and overthrow the Ottomans themselves. To that end, a secret organisation called the Brotherhood of Liberty was established. Its function was to lobby foreign governments in preparation of the revolt, as well as to foster Greco-Bulgarian fraternity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA90822002;Greeks and Bulgars fraternising? Is this a fairy tale?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME90822003;An Abridged Recent History of Macedonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90822003;Influenced by the writings of Greek revolutionary Rigas Feraios, who dreamed of a unified Balkan federal republic in the 1790s, the Brotherhood of Liberty was able to achieve some level of unity, although the rivalry between Greeks and Bulgars still remains. Aside from the liberal elite which is organising the Revolution, the centuries-long distrust between the two nationalities persists. Despite this fact, the prospect of an independent Macedonia ruled jointly by the Greeks, who carry the heritage of ancient Macedon, and Bulgars, who have largely formed a majority of the population in the region since the middle ages, has managed to suppress the rivalry for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA90822003;This really *is* a fairy tale, then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC90822004;Perhaps the most important achievent of the Brotherhood, however, was the 1824 Conference of Naples. There, the Ottoman Empire's greatest rivals - Venice and Aragon - jointly agreed to aid the Greco-Bulgarian revolutionaries in their goal of independence from the Ottomans. In return, the Aragonese demanded that Martin Fernando Alfonso de Trastamara, Prince of Aragon, be placed on the throne of a future Macedonian kingdom. The Brotherhood of Liberty, though vehemently republican, was forced to agree to a Macedonian monarchy under the condition that it be an enlightened, constitutional one guided by the principles of the enlightenment and in alignment with Macedonia's distaste for despots.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC90822005;And so this is where Macedonia now finds herself. The Ottoman Empire has disintegrated under the weight of internal pressures, and the Brotherhood of Liberty has taken this opportunity to declare Macedonia an independent republic. Whether Macedonia can hold herself together despite the tensions between its ethnic groups is not known, but the prospect of a modern, independent state is enough to galvanise large parts of the population to the struggle. The future remains uncertain and there is a tough fight ahead - but we will not go gentle into that good night!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA90822005;To victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
